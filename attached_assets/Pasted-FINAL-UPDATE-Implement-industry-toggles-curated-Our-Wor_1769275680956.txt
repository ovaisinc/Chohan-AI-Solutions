FINAL UPDATE: Implement industry toggles + curated “Our Work” cards (balanced + premium)

In home.tsx, update the “Our Work” section to include:

A) INDUSTRY TOGGLES (top-level)
Create a horizontal, pill-style industry toggle row ABOVE the existing “AI & Automation / Data & Dashboards” toggle.
Industries (exact labels):
1) Amusement & Entertainment
2) Trucking & Logistics
3) Auto Dealerships
4) Marketing Agencies
5) Healthcare & Clinics
6) Real Estate
7) Finance & Accounting

Behavior:
- Default selected industry: Amusement & Entertainment
- Industry toggle row should be horizontally scrollable on mobile
- Active industry pill uses brand accent styling
- Smooth transitions when switching industries

B) CATEGORY TOGGLES (second row)
Keep the existing category toggle:
- AI & Automation
- Data & Dashboards
Default category: AI & Automation

C) CARD LIMIT (curated + balanced)
For every industry:
- Show EXACTLY 3 cards for AI & Automation
- Show EXACTLY 3 cards for Data & Dashboards
No more than 3 visible at a time per category (avoid clutter).
Keep the grid balanced: 3 columns desktop, 2 tablet, 1 mobile.

Each card must include:
- Category tag (AI & Automation or Data & Dashboards)
- Project title
- 1–2 sentence description (problem solved)
- Bold result metric line
- Dark theme styling: rounded-xl, border-white/10, subtle gradient background, soft hover glow, slight lift on hover
